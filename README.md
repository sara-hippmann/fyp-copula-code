# Modelling Multivariate Dependencies using Pair Copula Construction 
## Final Year Project by Sara Hippmann

## Empirical Analysis 1: Crypto Representative Selection Using C-Vines
- cryptodata.csv provides the dataset for this analysis
- CvineRepSelectCrypto.R shows the code used

## Empirical Analysis 2: Comparative Analysis of Copula Structures
- thesisdata.csv provides the data set
- ComparativeCopulaAnalysis.R shows the code used to generate the different copula structures and compare goodness-of-fit

## Empirical Analysis 3: Using Copulas to Visualise Changes in Dependence Structures
- the original thesisdata.csv file is split according to the 3 periods of interest; pre-, during and post-Covid to give the files thesisdata2pre.csv, thesisdata2during.csv, thesisdata2post.csv respectively
- EmpiricalAnalysis2pre.R, EmpiricalAnalysis2during.R and EmpiricalAnalysis2post.R provide the code used for the analysis in each respective period

## Additional
- the CopulaVisualisations.R file shows how the figures in the final report of the different types of copulas were generated
